# CSC-491: Senior Project at Cal Poly SLO

## Overview

### The need for a job bot

In my own world I have been steadily applying for jobs. The bad part about it however is I spend hours a day doing the same task over and over and I definately miss a lot of oppurtunities. If companies are already cycling through peoples resumes automatically, I figure that I should do the same for this project and apply automatically. This bot would be a very beneficial bot to use as it could apply, atleast as fast as me, throughout the day and save me dozens of hours of time.

### Objective

Create a bot that has the ability to find potential jobs and a bot to automatically fill out forms.

### Milestones

- Create bot to login with selenium
- Find jobs that match criteria
- Compile or otherwise notify user of the data
- Automatically apply and notify
- Structure into a UI
- Create user guide on use of the program

## Requirements

### Psychical:
There will be no required physical materials for this project. Eventually this project may include a web based app, which would require some server hosting.

### Non-Psychical:
Python library requirements will be listed in the requirements doc.
