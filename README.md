# CSC-491: Senior Project at Cal Poly SLO

## Overview

### Preamble of Mario Minigame Madness

Mario Minigame madness is an old school game that I used to play when I was 10. It is very simplistic and 2D meaning generating an AI to play the game should be made possible by myself alone. The game has clearly defined edges and graphics which will also help with the project. The basis of the game is to play various minigames and get highscores. There is no engame objective, just beat your high score. The minigames are typically time based, and require fast recognition, reflexes, and or memory. An example of a game is, spot the Mario in a collage of Waluigis, Warios, and Yoshis. This game is not only nostalgic to me, but to a lot of other people. The youtuber as explained later I was inspired by, has over 1M views on his two part series on making a bot for this game.

### Objective

Develop an AI that can play Mario Minigame madness games. Heavily inspired by Youtuber [TODO], the goal of the project is to first make an AI that can get a reasonable score on each minigame. Then to further optimize the program to be better and better resolving issues along the way. The goal post would be beating the Youtuber. Further objectives could be to program for more minigames than was covered by the Youtuber, creating UI to better manage and use the bot, and a possible formal presentation for the uses of this AI. A good format would be to create a Youtube video summarizing, comparing, and contrasting my own design decisions vs the Youtuber.

Furthermore implementing reusable and well designed code will be a priority since code will most certainly be shared among the different games.

### Milestones

Milestones will be variable in how much I want to invest in a minigame at a time. If I get stuck or need to try new things, I can work on any other game without any conflict. The milestone for each individual game will be as follows.
- Devising strategy
- Playing the game
- Beating the youtubers score

For bigger milestones of the project
- Well designed code base
- Completing all minigames, that the youtuber did
- Adding UI functionality to use the bot (extra)
- Creating a youtube video (extra)

### Ethics

The Mario Minigame bot will have no influence on anyone else other than my own. There is no online interaction, only offline. This bot could potentially be used to generate fake highscores, however gameplay will obviously look like a bot, and highscores are not something specifically tracked for people to compete with each other. (I.e. nothing like a speedrun).
